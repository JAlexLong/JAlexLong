ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JAlexLong, also known as Alex Long.

- After teaching music for 4 years, I am now a first year computer science teacher.

- For the last several years I have found my passion shift from music education toward computer science and software engineering. I've always loved computer programming and have done it as a hobby for years. I never had the confidence in myself to pursue it in college, but I am a much different person than I was in college. Through determination, perseverance, and my experiences as a teacher, I want to break into the field and become a professional cloud solutions architect.

- I'm currently doing freelance work at Upwork on the side to gain practical experience with JavaScript, Python, Google Apps Script, and MongoDB. I am also teaching my students Python Programming (years 1 & 2) and Cybersecurity.

- Aside from my focus on perfecting my crafts, I love working with people. I am a firm believer that I can work with absolutely anybody without difficulty. My experience as a building testing coordinator has given me the insight as to what makes a good leader as well as a humble servant to the community. Positivity, encouragement, and high-quality communication are things that I value greatly as my contribution to my work environment.

If you want to reach out to me for any reason, please email me at johnalexanderlong@gmail.com or leave me a message at â€ª(479) 222-0421â€¬.
