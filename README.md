ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @WildeCode, also known as Alex Long.

- I am a first year computer science teacher who loves to see others grow and thrive. What started as a boy loving to play on drum set with his dad turned into 4 years of mentoring children of all ages to be the best musician they can be as a music teacher.

- This year, however, I have found my passion shift towards computer science and software engineering. I've always loved computer programming and have done it as a hobby for years. I never had the confidence in myself, though, to pursue it as a profession. Through determination, perseverance, and my experiences as a teacher, I want to break into the field and become a professional developer.

- I'm currently doing freelance work at Upwork on the side to gain practical experience with JavaScript, Python, Google Apps Script, and MongoDB.

- Aside from my focus on perfecting my crafts, I love working with people. I am a firm believer that I can work with absolutely anybody without difficulty. Being a building testing coordinator has helped give me the insight as to what makes a good leader, as well as a humble servant to the community. Positivity, encouragement, and high quality communication are things that I engage in regularly and naturally.

If you want to reach out to me for any reason, please email me at johnalexanderlong@gmail.com or leave me a message at â€ª(479) 222-0421â€¬.
